You can take the compiled code and use it in your project: https://github.com/AlexAPPi/playcanvas-terrain-system/blob/main/build/Scripts/terrain-system.js

Or make changes to it:

First you need to initialize the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/AlexAPPi/playcanvas-terrain-system.git
npm install
```

You need to set up a project to work with the editor: https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/scripting/vscode-extension/

After setting up the project, you can start building.

Next you need to run the build, you can build the project or run automatic file change tracking:

```
npm run amd-build:debug // for build
npm run amd-watch-push:debug // for watch
```
